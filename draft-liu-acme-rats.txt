1.  Introduction

   ACME [RFC8555] is a standard protocol for issuing and renewing
   certificates automatically.  When an ACME client needs a certificate,
   it connects to the ACME server, providing a proof of control of a
   desired identity.  Upon success, it then receives a certificate with
   that identity in it.

   These identities become part of the certificate, usually a Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that goes into the Subject Alt Name
   (SAN) for a certificate.  Prior to ACME, the authorization process of
   obtaining a certificate from an operator of a (public) certification
   authority was non-standard and ad-hoc.  It ranged from sending faxes
   on company letterhead to answering an email sent to a well-known
   email address like hostmaster@example.com, evolving into a process
   where some randomized nonce could be placed in a particular place on
   the target web server.  The point of this process is to prove that
   the given DNS FQDN was controlled by the client system.

   ACME standardized the process, allowing for automation for
   certificate issuance.  It has been a massive success: increasing
   HTTPS usage from 27% in 2013 to over 80% in 2019 [letsencrypt].

   While the process supports many kinds of identifiers: email
   addresses, DTN node IDs, and can create certificates for client use.
   However, these combinations have not yet become as popular, in part
   because these types of certificates are usually located on much more
   general purpose systems such as laptops and computers used by people.

   The concern that Enterprises have with the use of client side
   certificates has been the trustworthiness of the client system
   itself.  Such systems have many more configurations, and are often
   considered harder to secure as a result.  While well managed mutual
   TLS (client and server authentication via PKIX certificate) has
   significant advantages over the more common login via username/
   passowrd, if the private key associated with a client certificates is
   disclosed or lost, then the impact can be more significant.

   The use case envisioned here is that of an enterprise.  A Network
   Operations Center (NOC) (which may be internal or an external
   contracted entity) will issue (client) certificates to devices that
   can prove via remote attestation that they are running an up-to-date
   operating system as well as the enterprise-required endpoint security
   software.

   This is a place where Remote Attestation can offer additional
   assurance [RFC9334].  If the software on the client is properly
   designed, and is up to date, then it is easier to assure that the
   private key will be safe.

   This can be extended to Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) by having those
   devices provide an equivalent Attestation Result.

   In this document, we propose an approach where ACME Server MAY
   challenge the ACME Client to produce an Attestation Evidence or
   Attestation Result in any format that is supported by the RATS
   Conceptual Message Wrapper [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap], for instance, an
   EAT (entity attestation token).  The ACME Server then verifies the
   attestation result against an appraisal policy as required by by the
   requested certificate profile.

   ACME can presently offer certificates with multiple identities.
   Typically, in a server certificate situation, each identity
   represents a unique FQDN that would be placed into the certificate as
   distinct Subject Alt Names (SAN).  For instance each of the names:
   example.com, www.example.com, www.example.net and
   marketing.example.com might be placed in a single certificate for a
   server that provides web content under those four names.

   This document defines a new identity type, trustworthy that the ACME
   client can ask for.  A new attestation-result-01 challenge is defined
   as a new method that can be used to authorize this identity using a
   RATS Passport model.  The encrypted-evidence-02 challenge is also
   defined, enabling a background check mechanism.

   In this way, the Certification Authority (CA) or Registration
   Authority (RA) issues certificates only to devices that can provide
   an appropriate attestation result, indicating that the device from
   which the ACME request originates has passed the required security
   checks.

   Attested ACME requests can form an essential building block towards
   the continuous monitoring/validation requirement of Zero-Trust
   principle when coupled with other operational measures, such as
   issuing only short-lived certificates.

   For ease of denotion, we omit the "ACME" adjective from now on, where
   Server means ACME Server and Client means ACME Client.

1.1.  Attestation Results only

   This document currently only defines the a mechanism to carry
   Attestation Results from the ACME client to the ACME server.  It
   limits itself to the Passport model defined in [RFC9334].

   This is done to simplify the combinations, but also because it is
   likely that the Evidence required to make a reasonable assessment
   includes potentially privacy violating claims.  This is particularly
   true when a device is a personal (BYOD) device; in that case the
   Verifier might not even be owned by the Enterprise, but rather the
   device manufacturer.

   In order to make use of the background check that Evidence would need
   to be encrypted from the Attesting Environment to the Verifier, via
   the ACME Server -- the Relying Party.  Secondly, in order for the
   ACME Server to be able to securely communicate with an Enterprise
   located Verifier with that Evidence, then more complex trust
   relationships would need to be established.  Thirdly, the Enterprise
   Verifier system would then have to expose itself to the ACME Server,
   which may be located outside of the Enterprise.  The ACME Server, for
   resiliency and loading reasons may be a numerous and dynamic cluster
   of systems, and providing appropriate network access controls to
   enable this communication may be difficult.

   Instead, the use of the Passport model allows all Evidence to remain
   within an Enterprise, and for Verifier operations to be more self-
   contained.

1.2.  Related work

   [CSRATT] define trustworthy claims about the physical storage
   location of a key pair's private key.  This mechanism only relates to
   how the private key is kept.  It does not provide any claim about the
   rest of the mechanisms around access to the key.  A key could well be
   stored in the most secure way imaginable, but in order to use the key
   some command mechanism must exist to invoke it.

   The mechanism created in this document allows certification authority
   to access the trustworthiness of the entire system.  That accessment
   goes well beyond how and where the private key is stored.  ACME uses
   Certificate Signing Requests, so there is no reason that [CSRATT]
   could not be combined with the mechanism described in this document.

   [RATSPA] defines a summary of a local assessment of posture for
   managed systems and across various layers.  The claims and mechanisms
   defined in [RATSPA] are a good basis for the assessment that will
   need to be done in order to satisfy the trustworthiness challenge
   detailed in this document.

2.  Extensions -- trustworthy identifier

   This is a new identifier type.

   type (required, string):  The string "trusthworthy".

   value (required, string):  The constant string "trustworthy"

   The following sections detail the changes.

2.1.  Step 1: newOrder Request Object

   During the certificate order creation step, the Client sends a
   /newOrder JWS request (Section 7.4 of [RFC8555]) whose payload
   contains an array of identifiers.

   The client adds the trustworthy identifier to the array.

   This MUST NOT be the only identifier in the array, as this identity
   type does not, on its own, provide enough authorization to issue a
   certificate.  In this example, a dns identity is chosen for the
   domain name client01.finance.example.

   An example extended newOrder JWS request:

     POST /acme/new-order HTTP/1.1
     Content-Type: application/json
     {
       "protected": base64url({
         "alg": "ES256",
       }),
       "payload": base64url({
         "identifiers": [
           { "type": "truthworthy", "value": "trustworthy" },
           { "type": "dns", "value": "client01.finance.example" },
         ],
       }),
       "signature": "H6ZXtGjTZyUnPeKn...wEA4TklBdh3e454g"
     }

2.2.  Step 2: Order Object

   As explained in [RFC8555], Section 7.1.3, the server returns an Order
   Object.

   An example extended Order Object that includes

     POST /acme/new-order HTTP/1.1
     ...

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json
     {
       "status": "pending",

       "identifiers": [
         { "type": "trustworthy", "value": "trustworthy" },
         { "type": "dns",         "value": "0123456789abcdef" },
       ],

       "authorizations": [
         "https://example.com/acme/authz/PAniVnsZcis",
         "https://example.com/acme/authz/C1uq5Dr+x8GSEJTSKW5B",
       ],

       "finalize": "https://example.com/acme/order/T..fgo/finalize",
     }

   Note that the URLs listed in the authorizations array are arbitrary
   URLs created by the ACME server.  The last component is a randomly
   created string created by the server.  For simplicity, the first URL
   is identical to the example given in [RFC8555].

2.3.  Step 3: Authorization Object

   The Server has created an Authorization Object for the trustworthy
   and dns identifiers.

   The client accesses each authorization object from the URLs given in
   the Order Object.  In this example, the PAniVnsZcis authorization
   relates to the dns identifier, and it is not changed from [RFC8555],
   Section 8.

   The C1uq5Dr+x8GSEJTSKW5B authorization is a new authorization type,
   trustworthy, it is detailed in Section 3 and Section 4.

   Here is an example:

      GET https://example.com/acme/authz/C1uq5Dr+x8GSEJTSKW5B HTTP/1.1
      ..

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json
      {
        "status": "pending",
        "expires": "2025-09-30T14:09:07.99Z",

        "identifier": {
          "type": "trustworthy",
          "value": "trustworthy"
        },

        "challenges": [
          {
            "type": "trustworthy",
            "status": "pending",
            "token": "yoW1RL2zPBzYEHBQ06Jy",
            "url": "https://example.com/acme/chall/prV_8235AD9d",
          }
        ],
      }

2.4.  Step 4: Obtain Attestation Result

   The client now uses the token yoW1RL2zPBzYEHBQ06Jy as a fresh nonce.
   It produces fresh Evidence, and provides this to the Verifier.

   The details of this step are not in scope for this document.  As an
   example, it might use TPM-CHARRA [RFC9684], or X, or Y (XXX: insert
   more options)

   The format result is described in Section 3.2 and Section 4.2.  (An
   example from [I-D.ietf-rats-ar4si] would be good here)

   This result is sent as a POST to https://example.com/acme/chall/
   prV_8235AD9d

   POST https://example.com/acme/chall/prV_8235AD9d HTTP/1.1
   ..

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/cmw+cbor

   yePAuQj5xXAnz87/7ItOkDTk5Y4syoW1RL2zPBzYEHBQ06JyUvZDYPYjeTqwlPszb9Grbxw0UAEFx5DxObV1

   (EDIT: change to cwm+jws example)

   The Server decodes the provided CMW [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap].  The
   Attestation Results found within will be digitally signed by the
   Verifier.

   The Server MUST verify the signature.  The signature MUST be from a
   Verifier that the ACME Server has a trust anchor for.  The list of
   trust anchors that a Server will trust is an attribute of the ACME
   Account in use.  The details of how these trust anchors are
   configured is not in scope for this document.

   At this point, if the client were to retrieve the authorization
   object from step 3, it would observe (if everything was accepted,
   verified) that the status for this challenge would now be marked as
   valid.

2.5.  Step 5: Perform other challenges

   The client SHOULD now perform any other challenges that were listed
   in the Order Object from step 2.  ACME provides no ordering
   constraint on the challenges, so they could well have occured
   concurrently.

2.6.  Step 6: Finalize Order, retrieve certificate

   At this point, the process continues as described in [RFC8555],
   Section 7.4.  This means that the finalize action is used, which
   includes a CSR.  If all is well, it will result in a certificate
   being issued.

3.  ACME Extensions -- attestation-result-01 challenge type

   A attestation-result-01 challenge type asks the Client to prove
   provide a fresh Attestation Result.  This section describes the
   challenge/response extensions and procedures to use them.

3.1.  attestation-result-01 Challenge

   The attestation-result-01 Challenge works with Passport Model of
   RATS.

   The corresponding Challenge Object is:

   type (required, string):  The string "attestation-result-01".

   token (required, string):  A randomly created nonce provided by the
      server which MUST be included in the Attestation Results to
      provide freshness.

   attestClaimsHint (optional, list of string)  If the Server requires
      attestation of specific claims or properties in order to issue the
      requested certificate profile, then it MAY list one or more types
      of claims from the newly-defined ACME Attest Claims Hints registry
      defined in Section 5.

   Once fresh Attestation Results have been obtained from an appropriate
   RATS Verifier, then this result is posted to the URL provided in the
   url attribute.

3.2.  attestion-result-01 Response

   The data sent SHOULD be Attestation Results in the form of of a CMW
   [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap], Section 5.2 tagged JSON encoded Attestation
   Results for Secure Interactions (AR4SI) [I-D.ietf-rats-ar4si].  The
   CM-type MUST include attestation-results, and MUST NOT include any
   other wrapped values.  Other formats are permitted by prior
   arrangement, however, they MUST use the CMW format so that they can
   be distinguished.

4.  ACME Extensions -- attestation-evidence-01 challenge type

   A attestation-evidence-01 challenge type asks the Client to send
   fresh Evidence to the Server.  The Server will use the RATS
   background model to connect to a Verifier, obtaining Attestation
   Results.

4.1.  attestation-evidence-01 Challenge

   The attestation-evidence-01 Challenge works with Background Model of
   RATS.

   The corresponding Challenge Object is:

   type (required, string):  The string "attestation-evidence-01".

   token (required, string):  A randomly created nonce provided by the
      server which MUST be included in the Evidence to provide
      freshness.

   verifierEncryptionCredential (optional, base64 encoded)  This mode is
      for cases where the evidence of a device contains specific
      identifiers that could be linkable to a person and therefore
      qualify as Personally Identifiable Information.  In these cases,
      the Server MAY opt to pass the evidence encrypted to the Verifier
      so that it never needs to handle to decrypted PII.  The
      verifierENcryptionCredential can be of any type that is compatible
      with JWE encryption.

4.2.  attestion-evidence-01 Response

   Once fresh Evidence has been collected, then it is posted to the URL
   provided in the url attribute.

   The data sent SHOULD be Evidence in the form of of a CMW
   [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap], Section 5.2 tagged JSON encoded Evidence.
   The CMW-type MUST include Evidence, and MUST NOT include any other
   wrapped values.  Other formats are permitted by prior arrangement,
   however, they MUST use the CMW format so that they can be
   distinguished.

   If a verifierEncryptionCredential was provided by the Server, then
   the Client MUST encrypt the evidence by placing the entire CMW as the
   payload of a JWE encrypted for the verifierEncryptionCredential.

5.  ACME Attest Claims Hint Registry

   (EDIT: unclear if this is still important)

   In order to facilitate the Server requesting attestation of specific
   types claims or properties, we define a new registry of ACME Claims
   Hints.  In order to preserve flexibility, the Claim Hints are
   intended to be generic in nature, allowing for the client to reply
   with any type of attestation result that contains the requested
   information.  As such, these values are not intended to map one-to-
   one with any specific remote attestation evidence or attestation
   result format, but instead they are to serve as a hint to the ACME
   Client about what type of attestation it needs to collect from the
   device.  Ultimately, the CA's certificate policies will be the
   authority on what evidence or attestation results it will accept.

   The ACME Attest Claims Hint Registry is intended to help clients to
   collect evidence or attestation results that are most likely to be
   acceptable to the Server, but are not a guaranteed replacement for
   performing interoperability testing between a given attesting device
   and a given CA.  Similarly, an ACME attestation hint may not map one-
   to-one with attestation functionality exposed by the underlying
   attesting device, so ACME clients might need to act as intermediaries
   mapping ACME hints to vendor-specific functionality on a per-
   hardware-vendor basis.

   See Section 8.1 for the initial contents of this new registry.

6.  Example use cases

6.1.  Conflicting duties

   (EDIT: This text might be stale)

   1.  Integration/compatibility difficulty: Integrating SOC and NOC
       requires plenty of customized, case-by-case developing work.
       Especially considering different system vendors, system versions,
       different data models and formats due to different client
       needs... Let alone possible updates.

   2.  Conflict of duties: NOC people do not want SOC people to
       interfere with their daily work, and so do SOC people.  Also, NOC
       people may have limited security knowledge, and SOC people vice
       versa.  Where to draw the line and what is the best tool to help
       them collaborate is a question.

6.2.  Enterprise WiFi Access

   In enterprise access cases, security administrators wish to check the
   security status of an accessing end device before it connects to the
   internal network.  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) softwares
   can check the security/trustworthiness statuses of the device and
   produce an Attestation Result (AR) if the check passes.  ACME-RATS
   procedures can then be used to redeem a certificate using the AR.

   With that being said, a more specific use case is as follows: an
   enterprise employee visits multiple campuses, and connects to each
   one's WiFi.  For example, an inspector visits many (tens of) power
   substations a day, connects to the local WiFi, download log data,
   proceed to the next and repeat the process.

   Current access solution include: 1.  The inspector remembers the
   password for each WiFi, and conduct the 802.1X EAP password-based
   (PAP/CHAP/MS-CHAPv2) authentication. or 2. an enterprise MDM receives
   the passwords and usernames over application layer connection from
   the MDM server, and enter them on user's behalf.  While Solution 1
   obviously suffer from management burdens induced by massive number of
   password pairs, and password rotation requirements, the drawback of
   Solution 2 is more obsecure, which include:

   a.  Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) situation and MDM is not available.
   b.  Password could risk leakage due to APP compromise, or during
   Internet transmission.  Anyone with leaked password can access,
   without binding of trusted/usual devices. c.  The RADIUS Client/
   Access Point/Switch is not aware of the identity of the accessing
   device, therefore cannot enforce more fine-grained access policies.

   An ideal user story is: 1.  When the inspector is at base (or
   whenever the Remote Attestation-based check is available), he get his
   device inspected and redeem a certificate using ACME-RATS. 2.  When
   at substation, the inspector authenticate to the WiFi using EAP-TLS,
   where all the substations have the company root CA installed. 2*.
   Alternatively, the Step 2 can use EAP-repeater mode, where the RADIUS
   Client redirects the request back to the RADIUS Server for more
   advanced checks.

6.3.  BYOD devices

   Another example is issuing S/MIME certificates to BYOD devices only
   if they can prove via attestation that they are registered to a
   corporate MDM and the user they are registered to matches the user
   for which a certificate has been requested.

   In this case, the Server might challenge the client to prove that it
   is properly-registered to the enterprise to the same user as the
   subject of the requested S/MIME certificate, and that the device is
   running the corporate-approved security agents.

6.4.  Private key in hardware

   In some scenarios the CA might require that the private key
   corresponding to the certificate request is stored in cryptographic
   hardware and non-extractable.  For example, the certificate profile
   for some types of administrative credentials may be required to be
   stored in a token or smartcard.  Or the CA might be required to
   enforce that the private key is stored in a FIPS-certified HSM
   running in a configuration compliant with its FIPS certificate --
   this is the case, for example, with CA/Browser Forum Code Signing
   certificates [CABF-CSBRs] which can be attested for example via
   [RATSKA].

   It could also be possible that the requested certificate profile does
   not require the requested key to be hardware-backed, but that the CA
   will issue the certificate with extra assurance, for example an extra
   policy OID or a longer expiry period, if attestation of hardware can
   be provided.

7.  Security Considerations

   The attestation-result-01 challenge (the Passport Model) is the
   mandatory to implement.  The encrypted-evidence-01 challenge (the
   background-check model) is optional.

   In all cases the Server has to be able to verify Attestation Results
   from the Verifier.  To do that it requires appropriate trust anchors.

   In the Passport model, Evidence -- which may contain personally
   identifiable information (PII)) -- is never seen by the ACME Server.
   Additionally, there is no need for the Verifier to accept connections
   from ACME Server(s).  The Attester/Verifier relationship used in the
   Passport Model leverages a pre-existing relationship.  For instance
   if the Verifier is operated by the manufacturer of the Attester (or
   their designate), then this is the same relationship that would be
   used to obtain updated software/firmware.  In this case, the trust
   anchors may also be publically available, but the Server does not
   need any further relationship with the Verifier.

   In the background-check model, Evidence is sent from the Attester to
   the ACME Server.  The ACME Server then relays this Evidence to a
   Verifier.  The Evidence is encrypted so that the Server it never able
   to see any PII which might be included.  The choice of Verifier is
   more complex in the background-check model.  Not only does ACME
   Server have to have the correct trust anchors to verify the resulting
   Attestation Results, but the ACME Server will need some kind of
   business relationship with the Verifier in order for the Verifier to
   be willing to appraise Evidence.

   The trustworthy identifier and challenge/response is not an actual
   identifier.  It does not result in any specific contents to the
   certificate Subject or SubjectAltName.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  ACME Attest Claims Hint Registry

   IANA is requested to open a new registry, XXXXXXXX

   Type: designated expert

   The registry has the following columns:

   *  Claim Hint: the string value to be placed within an ACME device-
      attest-02 or device-attest-03 challenge.

   *  Descryption: a descryption of the general type of attestation
      evidence or attestation result that the client is expected to
      produce.

   The initial registry contents is shown in the table below.

       +================+=========================================+
       | Claim Hint     | Description                             |
       +================+=========================================+
       | FIPS_mode      | Attestation that the device is          |
       |                | currently booted in FIPS mode.          |
       +----------------+-----------------------------------------+
       | OS_patch_level | Attestation to the version or patch     |
       |                | level of the device's operating system. |
       +----------------+-----------------------------------------+
       | sw_manifest    | A manifest list of all software         |
       |                | currently running on the device.        |
       +----------------+-----------------------------------------+
